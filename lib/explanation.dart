// The provided code is a Flutter application that integrates with an API to fetch user data and display it in the app's UI. Here's a step-by-step description of the code:
//
// 1. The main function is the entry point of the Flutter app.
// It calls the `runApp` function to run the app, passing an instance of the `MyApp` widget.
//
// 2. The `User` class represents a user object with properties like
// `gender`, `title`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.
// It has a factory method `fromJson` that converts a JSON map into a `User` object.
//
// 3. The `MyApp` class is a stateless widget that represents the main app.
// It overrides the `build` method to define the app's UI.
//
// 4. The `fetchUser` method is an asynchronous function that sends an HTTP GET request to an API endpoint using the `http` package.
// It waits for the response and handles the response accordingly. If the response is successful (status code 200),
// it extracts the user data from the JSON response and creates a `User` object. It then returns an `AsyncSnapshot` with the `User` object as data. If the response is not successful, it returns an `AsyncSnapshot` with an error message.
//
// 5. In the `build` method, a `FutureBuilder` widget is used to handle the asynchronous `fetchUser` function.
// It takes a future (the `fetchUser` function) and a builder function.
// The builder function receives the current `context` and the `snapshot` of the `fetchUser` future. It checks the `snapshot.connectionState` to determine the current state of the future.
//
// 6. If the connection state is `ConnectionState.waiting`,
// it displays a circular progress indicator at the center of the screen to indicate that the data is being fetched.
//
// 7. If the connection state is `ConnectionState.done` and the snapshot has an error,
// it displays an error message indicating that the user data failed to load.
//
// 8. If the connection state is `ConnectionState.done` and the snapshot contains data,
// it extracts the `User` object from the snapshot and displays the user's name (title, first name, last name) and gender in a column at the center of the screen.
//
// 9. The `MaterialApp` widget provides the basic app structure, including the app's title and theme.
//
// 10. The `Scaffold` widget represents the app's layout structure and provides the app bar and body.
//
// 11. The `AppBar` widget displays the title of the app in the app bar.
//
// 12. The `body` property of the `Scaffold` widget contains the `FutureBuilder` widget,
// which determines the content to display based on the asynchronous `fetchUser` function's state.
//
// Overall, the code fetches user data from an API and displays it in the app's UI using Flutter's `FutureBuilder` widget.
// It handles different connection states and displays appropriate UI components based on the state of the asynchronous operation.



//EXPLANATION


// 1. The first line imports the `usermodel1.dart` file, which is assumed to contain the definition of the `User` model class.
// 2. The second line imports the `api_service1.dart` file, assumed to contain the `ApiService` class responsible for fetching user data.
// 3. The third line imports the `flutter/material.dart` library, which is necessary for building Flutter UI components.
// 4. The `main()` function is the entry point of the application. It runs the Flutter app by calling `runApp()` with an instance of `MyApp`.
// 5. The `MyApp` class is a stateful widget, representing the root of the application.
// 6. The `createState()` method of `MyApp` returns an instance of `_MyAppState`, which handles the internal state of `MyApp`.
// 7. The `_MyAppState` class is the state class for `MyApp` and extends the `State` class.
// 8. The `_userData` variable is a `Future` that will hold the user data fetched from the API.
// 9. The `_isLoading` variable is a boolean flag indicating whether the data is currently being loaded.
// 10. The `initState()` method is called when the state is initialized. In this case, it doesn't have any additional logic.
// 11. The `_fetchUser()` method is responsible for fetching user data from the API. It sets the `_isLoading` flag to true, initiates the API request, and updates the `_userData` variable with the result. Finally, it sets `_isLoading` to false when the API request completes.
// 12. The `build()` method is called to build the UI of the app.
// 13. The `MaterialApp` widget is the root of the app's widget tree, providing basic app configurations.
// 14. The `Scaffold` widget represents the basic structure of the app's visual layout, providing an app bar and a body.
// 15. The `AppBar` widget creates the app bar with a title.
// 16. The `body` property of `Scaffold` contains a `Column` widget, allowing multiple widgets to be stacked vertically.
// 17. Inside the `Column`, there are conditional widgets based on the value of `_userData`.
// 18. If `_userData` is null, it displays a centered `ElevatedButton` with the text 'Get Data', which, when pressed, calls the `_fetchUser()` method to initiate the API request.
// 19. If `_userData` is not null, it displays a `FutureBuilder` widget.
// 20. The `FutureBuilder` widget listens to the `Future` represented by `_userData`.
// 21. While the future is loading, it shows a `CircularProgressIndicator`.
// 22. If an error occurs during loading, it displays an error message.
// 23. Once the future completes successfully, it retrieves the user data from the `snapshot`.
// 24. It then displays the user's name and gender using the `Text` widget.
// 25. If `_isLoading` is false, it shows another centered `ElevatedButton` with the text 'Get Data', allowing the user to fetch data again.
//
// That's the explanation of the code segment. Each line is described with its purpose and functionality.
